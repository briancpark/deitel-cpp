<A NAME="Install"></A><H2>Installing the Software</H2>
<P>
Now that you have met the minimum requirements for the software installations,
read the <A HREF="MSEULA.HTM">license agreement.</A>
Please read the entire license and make sure you agree with it.
Now you are ready to install. 
</P>
<H3>Microsoft<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Visual C++<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> 6.0 Introductory Edition</H3>
<P>
When you put this CD into your CD-ROM drive, an Autorun splash screen appeared. In order to install Visual C++, you need to go back to that splash screen.
</P>

<H3><BIG><font color="#FF0000"><B><I>Go back to the screen that popped up when you loaded the CD.</I></B></font></BIG></H3>

<P>If you don't still have that splash screen on your desktop, eject the CD and reinsert it and 
the splash screen should reappear.
</P>
<P>
You will see a button for Microsoft<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Visual C++<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> 6.0 Introductory Edition.
Click the button to begin downloading and
installing the application. When done with the installation, reload this file in your browser.
</P>

<H3>Microsoft Service Pack</H3>
  
<P>
 By default, Visual C++ 6.0 Introductory Edition is designed to run with Microsoft  
 Internet Explorer 4.0. If you are running Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0, you  
 can download Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3
 at <A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/sp/vs6sp3/default.asp" TARGET="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/sp/vs6sp3/default.asp</A> to improve the interface. 
</P>


<P>
(<B>NOTE</B>: Currently Microsoft does not offer the Service Pack for
only Visual C++, so the entire 120 MB Visual Studio Service Pack 
has to be downloaded from the Web.)
</P>
