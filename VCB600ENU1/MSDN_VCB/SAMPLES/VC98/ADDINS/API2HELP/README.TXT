API2HELP:  Creates HTML and RTF files to include in a Help system.

This sample shows how to create and use add-ins. It demonstrates working
with various parts of the Developer Studio object model (primarily the Text
editor), and shows features that can only be used from add-ins (as opposed to
VBScript macros).

Running the Sample

1.  Start Developer Studio, and on the Tools menu, click Customize.
2.  Choose the Add-ins and Macro Files tab, click the Browse button, and load
	the API2Help.dll file.
	Note: API2Help creates a small toolbar that is visible when you close
	the Customize dialog box.
3.  Select a function prototype from a C/C++ source file.
4.  Click the API2Help button on the newly created toolbar, follow the
	prompts, and fill in the appropriate information in the File
	Generation Options dialog box.
5.  Modify your help system to include the newly generated files.
