1. Target Platform of the ICM 2.0 SDK
--------------------------------------
This SDK is for developing software for Windows® 98, 
and for version 5.0 of Windows NT® (both unreleased). The platforms 
currently available for testing software developed using this SDK are the 
Beta 2 and later releases of Windows 98 and the Beta 1 release of 
Windows NT version 5. For information about receiving a beta version of 
Windows 98, please contact:

2. Contents of the ICM 2.0 SDK
-------------------------------

When you installed the ICM 2.0 SDK, you specified a folder 
in which to install it, which was preferably the same folder 
in which the Microsoft Win32® SDK or Platform SDK is installed 
on your system. The setup program placed the following files 
in the folders under the installation folder that you specified:

NOTE: The ICMView sample requires the BITMAPV5HEADER structure to compile.  
This structure should be defined in the WINGDI.H file used in the 
compilation process.  If this structure is not defined, you will need 
to obtain an updated version of the Win32 or Windows Platform SDK.
