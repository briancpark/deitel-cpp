This example sets a reminder in TV Viewer for the following show:
<P>
Maid to Order<BR>
USA Network<BR>
8/5/97 3pm-5pm<BR>
<P>
If this episode is listed in your program guide, the reminder will display channel information, 
the station icon, and a description of the show.  Otherwise the station will be listed as -1, and
 the description information will be blank.
<P>
Note: If the current date is later than 8/5/97, you will need to 
adjust the script this page.  This is because you cannot set a reminder for an episode that 
has already been broadcast.  Edit the source of this page, setting the date to a future value.
<FORM>
<INPUT TYPE="Button" Name="SetIt" Value="SetReminder">
</FORM>
<HR>
To check that the reminder was set, open the Tasks folder. Typically this is C:\Windows\Tasks. The show reminder will appear as a task titled "Microsoft Television Services...". Right-click the task and select Properties to view the properties of the show reminder.
<P>
The show reminder is scheduled as a hidden task, so in order to view it, you must have folder options set to display hidden files. To do this highlight the Tasks folder from Windows Explorer and selecting Folder Options from the View window. Click the View tab. Select the <B>Show all files</B> radio button under the Hidden Files folder icon.
<P>
Note that because SchSamp uses TSS to se tthe reminder, it will not be visible from the Search page in TV Viewer.
