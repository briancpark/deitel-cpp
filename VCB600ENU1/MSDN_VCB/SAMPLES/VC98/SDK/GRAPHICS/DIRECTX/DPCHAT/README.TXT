DPCHAT ReadMe

This is a simple chat program to demonstrate usage of the DirectPlay APIs.

Note: MSVC may include older versions of the DirectX header files and
libraries.  This sample requires DirectX 5.  In order to avoid compile errors,
make sure the path to the DirectX 5 header files and libraries are listed
BEFORE the MSVC header files and libraries through the
Tools -> Options -> Directories menu.

Note: The DPLAUNCH or BELLHOP sample that is part of the DirectX 5 SDK can be
used to exercise the lobby functionality of DPCHAT.
