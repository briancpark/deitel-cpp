DirectInput Force Feedback Simple Sample 1

This application applies raw forces to a force feedback joystick,
illustrating how a simulator-type application can use force feedback
to generate forces computed by a physics engine.

The center of the program is the joySetForcesXY() function, which
accepts two-dimensional force data and sends it to the joystick.
