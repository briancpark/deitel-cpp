# The NTTARGETFILE entry tells BUILD to include MAKEFILE.INC and add "MISC" to
# the dependecies (Don't ask me how it tells it to do this).  We need this in
# order to get DDUTIL.CPP copied from the MISC directory into this directory.
# All files in the "SOURCE=" list have to be in the current directory. Take a
# look at MAKEFILE.INC in this directory.
