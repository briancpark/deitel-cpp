= DirectX DXBUG Bug Reporting Tool Readme =
===========================================

Overview
--------

DXBUG helps you file better bug reports.  It automatically picks up
various useful system information, such as the operating system version,
DirectX version, Display, Sound and Joystick driver information, then
allows you to enter your name and the bug description and save the bug
report as a text file that you can then paste into the mail that you
send us.  DXBUG will remember static information such as your name so
you don't have to re-key it for subsequent bugs that you file.


How to file bugs
----------------
1)  Run <sdkdir>\samples\Graphics\DirectX\dxbug\dxbug.exe, and wait for DXBUG 
    to extract the DirectX dll version numbers.

2)  Click on the 'Go to Bug Entry Form' button, and fill out all the fields
    in the 'Name and Bug Information' form.  

3)  Click the 'Done' button when you're done.

4)  Click 'Save Bug Data' to save all the information to a text file.  It
    will default to 'DXBug01.txt'.

5)  Edit 'DXBug01.txt' and paste the contents into your email.  Then email
    the report to dxbugs@microsoft.com.
