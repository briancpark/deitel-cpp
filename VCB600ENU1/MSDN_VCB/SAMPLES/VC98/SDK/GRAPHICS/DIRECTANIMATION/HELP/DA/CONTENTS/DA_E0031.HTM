<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>The Scripting Reference is organized by classes. For example, there is a section on the <A HREF="DA_E0045.htm" TARGET="TEXT">DAImage</A> class. Each class contains a description of its functions, including syntax, returned values, and how to use the function. At the end of each class, there is a list of functions that, while relevant to that particular class, are included in the <A HREF="DA_E0061.htm" TARGET="TEXT">DAStatics</A> library. This library is very large, and it may be easier to familiarize yourself with its contents by looking at specific classes and seeing what <B>DAStatics</B> functions are pertinent. When parameters are described as animated numbers, this means they must be of type <A HREF="DA_E0054.htm" TARGET="TEXT">DANumber</A>, not that they must necessarily change over time.
<P>This introduction contains the following topics:
<UL><LI><A CLASS=tctop HREF="DA_E0031.htm#vref_0001060101010000" TARGET="TEXT">Differences between VBScript and JScript</A>

</UL>
<H3><A NAME="vref_0001060101010000">Differences between VBScript and JScript</A></H3>
<P>Syntax and terminology are based on VBScript conventions. However, there are only a few simple differences between that and JScript. Those differences that pertain directly to Microsoft&#174; DirectAnimation&#153; are:

<UL><LI>This reference is organized according to Visual Basic conventions, which uses functions, which return values, and subroutines, which do not, and properties. JScript distinguishes between methods, which are always associated with objects, functions, which are not, and properties, which are analagous to Visual Basic properties.
<LI>The syntax differs only in that JScript ends with a semicolon while VBScript does not.
<LI>The syntax for creating a new object is different. The following example shows how to create new objects both in VBScript and JScript:
</UL>
<PRE><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="2">
// This is VBScript
Set myPt = CreateObject("DirectAnimation.DAPoint2")

// This is JScript
myPt = new ActiveXObject("DirectAnimation.DAPoint2");
</FONT></PRE>
<H3><A NAME="vref_0001060101020000">The PixelLibrary and the MeterLibrary</A></H3>
<P>The <A HREF="DA_E0115.htm#vref_0001060155020a00" TARGET="TEXT">MeterLibrary</A> and the <A HREF="DA_E0115.htm#vref_0001060155020e00" TARGET="TEXT">PixelLibrary</A> set the unit of measurement to meters or pixels respectively. Both return the <A HREF="DA_E0061.htm" TARGET="TEXT">DAStatics</A> object, so, to gain access to that library, one of these libraries must be chosen. There are two important differences between the libraries (other than the obvious one of different units of measurement). They are:

<UL><LI>The <A HREF="DA_E0115.htm#vref_0001060155020a00" TARGET="TEXT">MeterLibrary</A> considers positive-y to be up and the origin to be in the center of the view. The <A HREF="DA_E0115.htm#vref_0001060155020e00" TARGET="TEXT">PixelLibrary</A> considers positive-y to be down. 
<LI>If the <A HREF="DA_E0115.htm#vref_0001060155020e00" TARGET="TEXT">PixelLibrary</A> is chosen, pixels are the unit of measurement only when something is being constructed. Returned values are always in meters. For example, if you construct a <A HREF="DA_E0058.htm" TARGET="TEXT">DAPoint2</A> object in pixels and then ask for its x-coordinate, the value will be returned in meters.
