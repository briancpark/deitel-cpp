<DL><A NAME="gloss_00010b0107000001"></A><DT><B>file writer
 </B></DT><DD>The section of a filter graph that consists of the multiplexer and file writer filters.

</DD><A NAME="gloss_00010b0107000002"></A><DT><B>filter
 </B></DT><DD>A key component in the DirectShow architecture, a filter is a COM object that supports DirectShow interfaces or base classes. It might operate on streams of data in a variety of ways, such as reading, copying, modifying, or writing the data to a file. Sources, transform filters, and renderers are all particular types of filters. A filter contains pins that it uses to connect to other filters.



</DD><A NAME="gloss_00010b0107000003"></A><DT><B>filter graph
 </B></DT><DD>A collection of <A HREF="dssd0396.htm#gloss_00010b0107000002" TARGET="TEXT">filter</A>s. Typically, a filter graph contains filters that are connected to perform a particular operation, such as playing back a media file, or capturing video from a VCR to the hard disk.



</DD><A NAME="gloss_00010b0107000004"></A><DT><B>Filter Graph Editor
 </B></DT><DD>A graphical tool included with the DirectShow SDK that creates and manages filter graphs. It enables you to easily create filter graphs by inserting filters, clicking, and dragging to form connections.

</DD><A NAME="gloss_00010b0107000005"></A><DT><B>filter graph manager
 </B></DT><DD>A component that oversees the connection of filters in a filter graph, and controls the media stream's data flow. Filters must be connected in the proper order, and the data stream must be started and stopped in the proper order. The filter graph manager does this, and can also search for a set of filters that will render a particular media type and build its filter graph. When an application starts, pauses, or stops the media stream, plays for a particular duration or seeks to a particular point in the stream, the filter graph manager calls the appropriate methods on the filters to implement this stream control.






</DD><A NAME="gloss_00010b0107000006"></A><DT><B>flushing protocol
 </B></DT><DD>A protocol that defines how filters flush data through the filter graph.

</DD><A NAME="gloss_00010b0107000007"></A><DT><B>format type
 </B></DT><DD>A <A HREF="dssd0397.htm#gloss_00010b0108000001" TARGET="TEXT">GUID</A> value that indicates what a format block contains. 
DirectShow defines a number of major types, for example, the video type. These major types have a format block, such as <A HREF="dssd0287.htm#structs_0001060501001e00" TARGET="TEXT">VIDEOINFOHEADER</A>, that describes the media data. The format block for a particular media type is specified by a GUID in the <A HREF="dssd0287.htm#structs_0001060501000300" TARGET="TEXT">AM_MEDIA_TYPE</A> structure. This GUID is called the <I>format type</I>. If the format block contains <B>VIDEOINFOHEADER</B>, the format type GUID will be FORMAT_VideoInfo.
