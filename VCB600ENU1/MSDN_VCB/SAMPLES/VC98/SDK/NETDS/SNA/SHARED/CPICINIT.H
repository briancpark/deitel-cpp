 *  CHANGE HISTORY:
 *  Date       Description
 *  08/05/92   Version 2.31 of APING, ATELL and AREXEC released to CompuServe.
 *             This version was also distributed at the APPC/APPN Platform
 *             Developer's Conference held in Raleigh, NC.
 *  08/23/92   Removed cpicinit_default_destination() and associated
 *             processing.   After review, we decided that this call was
 *             extraneous and that cpicinit_default_sym_dest_name() was
 *             a better mechanism for a default destination.
 *  11/13/92   Changed most return values from TRUE/FALSE to CPICINIT_OK and
 *             other return codes.

 *
 * OVERVIEW OF CPICINIT CALLS
 *
 * cpicinit_new()                     Creates a CPICINIT object.
 *                                    This must be done before any other
 *                                    cpicinit calls can be used.
 *
 * cpicinit_default_tp_name()         These calls set the initial values
 * cpicinit_default_mode_name()       for CPICINIT parameters.  These should
 * cpicinit_default_sym_dest_name()   all be issued right after the CPICINIT
 *                                    object is created.
 *
 * cpicinit_set_tp_name()             These calls also set the values for
 * cpicinit_set_mode_name()           CPICINIT parameters.  These calls should
 * cpicinit_set_destination()         be used to set values from user input
 *                                    or profile values.
 *
 *   Security calls - only available where supported by CPI-C
 * cpicinit_set_userid                Sets the userid for the conversation.
 * cpicinit_set_password              Sets the password for the conversation.
 * cpicinit_query_password_needed     If a userid was set, then a password
 *                                    is required.
 * cpicinit_get_password              Let cpicinit prompt the user for a
 *                                    password.
 * cpicinit_set_security_type         Set the security type for this conv.
 *
 * cpicinit_setup_conversation()      Handles all CMINIT and set calls.
 *                                    Should be used by the calling program
 *                                    instead of CMINIT.  See description
 *                                    of the procedure for more details.
 *
 * cpicinit_destroy()                 Destroys the CPICINIT object.
 *
 * cpicinit_pln_valid()               These are internal calls used by
 * cpicinit_mode_valid()              cpicinit_setup_conversation.
