 *
 *  FUNCTION:  Perform an echo test to a specified destination.
 *             APING can be used when you are first installing APPC on
 *             your computer to make sure you can connect to another
 *             computer in the network.  APING can also be used to
 *             get an estimate of the delay time or throughput to another
 *             computer in the network.
 *
 *  AVAILABILITY:
 *             These sample programs and source are also available on
 *             CompuServe through the APPC Information Exchange.  To get
 *             to the APPC forum just type 'GO APPC' from any CompuServe
 *             prompt.  The samples are available in the Sample Programs
 *             library section.  Just search on the keyword CPICPGMS to
 *             find all the samples in this series.
 *
 *             Updates for the sample programs and support for many more
 *             CPI-C platforms will also be made available on CompuServe.
 *
 *  RELATED FILES:
 *             See APING.DOC for detailed information.
 *
 *  PORTABILIITY NOTES:
 *             The APING client program is completely portable.  In fact,
 *             all of the source modules can be compiled without #define-ing
 *             any platform constant value.
 *
 *             To take advantage of a performance optimization on the
 *             OS/2 platform, the alloc_cpic_buffer() is used.  If the
 *             OS/2 platform is specified (#define of OS2, FAPI, or OS2_20)
 *             alloc_cpic_buffer() will return a shared memory buffer.
 *             If not, a buffer allocated with malloc() will be returned.
 *
 *             If you are porting to a platform that can take advantage
 *             of a specially allocated memory buffer, you should
 *             add this support to the alloc_cpic_buffer() routine in the
 *             CPICPORT.C file.
 *
 *             The get_time() routine is used to determine the current time,
 *             which is in turn used to calculate the elapsed time of the
 *             data transfer.  The get_time() routine is used to hide
 *             differences between operating system timer facilties that
 *             are available.  Since the C library routine to query the
 *             current time only returns the time in seconds, it is
 *             advantageous to return the current time in milliseconds
 *             if it is available.
 *
 *             If you are porting to a platform that support a timer
 *             with a resolution better than one second, you should
 *             modify the get_time() routine in the CPICPORT.C file.
 *
 *  CHANGE HISTORY:
 *  Date       Description
 *  06/15/92   NS/DOS accepts version 2.02 into system test.
 *  08/05/92   Version 2.31 released to CompuServe
 *             This version was also distributed at the APPC/APPN Platform
 *             Developer's Conference held in Raleigh, NC.
 *  08/13/92   Changed all printf and fprintf calls to use a write_*() call.
 *  08/17/92   Made security handling code conditionally compiled.
 *  08/23/92   Removed call to cpicinit_default_destination().
 *  08/24/92   Version 2.32 released to CompuServe.
 *  08/28/92   Changed message about invalid size parm to go to write_error().
 *  09/08/92   Added check for buffer==NULL.  Initialized block to zeros.
 *  09/22/92   Version 2.33 released to CompuServe.
 *  11/17/92   Added support for printing remote operating system name.
 *             Version 2.34 released to CompuServe
 *  01/07/93   Version 2.35
 *             Fixed a number of problems when compiling with IBM C Set/2
 *                password input was displayed
 *                timer resolution was 1 second
