Readme.txt for the DSBrowse.exe

DSBrowse.exe is a sample VB application that demonstrates the ease with which VB application developers can quickly put together utilities for viewing/managing Directory Services.

DSBrowse performs the following tasks

1] It can enumerate through multiple namespaces (each corresponding to a Directory Service).  For each object found in a Directory Service hierarchy, it  provides a brief description of the object. Double clicking on a object  (container) will result in enumerating objects within that container.

2] Reading and writing properties on the DS object. Clicking on the properties button allows you to display the properties on an object. You can select a specific property and update it by pressing the "Set" button.

Requirements -
1] You must have Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0a Professional or Enterprise Edition installed on your machine. Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0a Professional or Enterprise Edition is available only on x86 platforms.
