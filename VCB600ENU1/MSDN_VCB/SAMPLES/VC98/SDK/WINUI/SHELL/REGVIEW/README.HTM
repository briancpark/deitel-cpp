<FONT COLOR="Navy"><P><B>RegView</B> is a simple example of a shell name space extension. It implements the minimum number of interfaces required to create a multi-level name space extension.

<P><B>RegView</B> will display the registry similar to the way that REGEDIT.EXE does, except that the registry information can only be viewed. The sample does not support modification of the registry, although this functionality can be added if desired. Once the extension DLL is built and registered, an item called "Registry View" will be available on the desktop and within the Explorer tree. Note: this sample will not run or build on Alpha and will only run with IE4 final release or later.

<P>Once the sample is built, it can register itself. If you use the Visual C++ 5.0 project file included with the sample (RegView.dsw) to build this project, it will automatically register the server when the server is built. The included command line make file (makefile) will also attempt to register the server. If you need to register the server manually, just execute the following from the command line, substituting the path where the DLL is located for "&lt;path&gt;":</FONT>
