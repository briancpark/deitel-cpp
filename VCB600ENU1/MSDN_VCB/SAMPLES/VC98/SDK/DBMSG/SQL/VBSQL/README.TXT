          DB-LIBRARY FOR VISUAL BASIC SAMPLE PROGRAMS
****************************************************************
This file tells about the DB-Library for Visual Basic sample
programs included with Microsoft(R) SQL Workstation 6.0. The
information in this file supplements the information in your 
Microsoft SQL Workstation documentation.

DB-LIBRARY FOR VISUAL BASIC SAMPLE APPLICATIONS

DB-Library for Visual Basic provides a set of sample applications
that demonstrate the use of many DB-Library for Visual Basic functions
and routines.

You can use the code in these sample applications as models or
templates for your own applications. By cutting and pasting code from
specific application files, by using global procedures from the sample
common code files, and by including the declarations for those
procedures from the sample include files, you can quickly create the
foundation for your own applications.

The QUERY sample application demonstrates the following SQL Server 
operations. Each sample:
* Logs in and opens a connection to SQL Server from the client.
* Allows a user to choose which database to use.
* Allows the user to send a query to SQL Server.
* Accepts results from SQL Server and returns the results to the user.
* Closes the SQL Server connection.
* Exits the application.
* Handles any errors or messages generated by these operations.

The rest of this file describes the contents of all of the Project
files used by the QUERY sample application. This information is
organized by the names of the subdirectories in which each Project
file resides.

Once you are familiar with the QUERY sample applications and their
use of the common code directories, refer to the other sample
applications provided for examples of implementing additional
SQL Server features.

COMMON CODE

The files in the subdirectory DBLIB\VSAMPLES\COMMON contain general
code that can be used by all DB-Library for Visual Basic applications.
The QUERY sample application include all of the COMMON files with 
their Project files and invoke the procedures that these files contain.
The following sections describe the files contained in the COMMON
subdirectory.

The VBSQLGEN.BAS File
The VBSQLGEN.BAS module defines a set of procedures that perform tasks 
common to most DB-Library for Visual Basic applications. Such tasks
include:
* Opening and closing a SQL Server connection
* Processing SQL queries 
* Executing SQL commands 
* Displaying error messages 

The LOGIN.FRM File
The LOGIN.FRM file calls a subroutine in the VBSQLGEN.BAS module that
uses DB-Library for Visual Basic functions to open a SQL Server
connection and log in users. The code for logging in users is used in
all of the sample applications except the browse-mode example.

The CHNGDB.FRM File
The CHNGDB.FRM file uses the DB-Library for Visual Basic function
SqlUse% to change the current database to a database name supplied
by the user. The code for changing databases is used in all of the
sample applications.

THE WINCODE DIRECTORY

The files in the DBLIB\VSAMPLES\WINCODE subdirectory contain code
that is available for use by all applications. To use the common code,
you can add the files to a Visual Basic Project or you can copy the
code from these files into an existing file. The following sections
describe the files in the WINCODE subdirectory.

INIEXITW.BAS
INIEXITW.BAS contains DB-Library initialization and exit code.

RESULTSW.BAS
RESULTSW.BAS contains procedures for handling compute rows and stored 
procedure output parameters. These procedures are called by the 
Process_Sql_query procedure defined in VBSQLGEN.BAS.

THE VBQUERY DIRECTORY

The directory DBLIB\VSAMPLES\QUERY include the project make file for
the sample application and the sample application's primary, or
startup, form, VBQUERY.FRM.

VBQUERY.BAS and VBSQL.BAS
VBQUERY.BAS and VBSQL.BAS contain the global definitions for this 
application. They include the relevant variable definitions from
GENGLOB.BAS. These are required. The VBSQL.BAS file contains the
global definitions for VBSQL functions and constants.

ADDITIONAL SAMPLE APPLICATIONS

This section provides information about some of the other
DB-Library for Visual Basic sample applications provided in your
package.

The TEXT Sample Application
The TEXT sample application enables users to select text files from
a database, and view and edit the text in the text file.

The TEXT.FRM file of the TEXT project contains the code of the main
form of the application. It includes subroutines for selecting, 
retrieving, and editing text files. For example, the LoadText
subroutine contains DB-Library for Visual Basic functions that read
text fields from database tables; the InsertText subroutine contains
DB-Library for Visual Basic functions that insert text into database
text tables.

The IMAGE Sample Application
The IMAGE sample application enables users to select image files from
a database, view images, and add images to a database. It looks and
works much like the preceding TEXT sample application.

The IMAGE.FRM file of the IMAGE project contains the code of the
main form of the application. It includes subroutines for selecting,
retrieving, and adding image files. For example, the LoadImage 
subroutine contains DB-Library functions that read images from 
databases; the InsertImage subroutine contains DB-Library functions
that insert images into databases.

The BROWSE Sample Application
The BROWSE sample application demonstrates the use of DB-Library
for Visual Basic browse-mode functions. The BROWSE project uses the
common code files VBSQLGEN.BAS and ABOUT.FRM. The code from the
GENGLOB.BAS file is included in the BROWSE.BAS global file.

The BLOGIN.FRM file includes the code from the common code file
LOGIN.FRM. However, because the browse mode requires two SQL Server
connections, the code to open a connection is repeated. The
OK_BUTTON_Click subroutine of the BLOGIN.FRM file illustrates the
correct way to open SQL Server connections for browsing.

The BROWSE.FRM file of the BROWSE project contains the code of
the main form of the application. It includes subroutines for
selecting, retrieving, and updating rows of information. For example,
the Select_Button_Click subroutine sends a command to query
SQL Server and processes the results of the query; the 
Update_Button_Click subroutine sends a command to update or change 
information in results rows; the ProcessResultRow subroutine 
processes the data in a results row. This subroutine is used in 
the Select_Button_Click subroutine mentioned previously.

The CURSORS Sample Application
The CURSORS sample application illustrates the use of cursors in
DB-Library for Visual Basic applications. The CURSORS project uses
the common code files VBSQLGEN.BAS, and LOGIN.FRM. The code from 
the GENGLOB.BAS file is included in the CURSORS.BAS global file.
The CURSORS.FRM file of the CURSORS project contains the code of 
the main form of the application. It includes subroutines for 
opening and closing cursors, fetching rows of data, updating rows, 
and displaying rows.

The RPC Sample Application
The RPC sample application shows the use of SqlRpcSend% and related
calls. This sample invokes stored procedures directly (not through
a language command) and retrieves return status and output 
parameters. Direct invocation of stored procedures is especially 
useful with Open Data Services applications. The sample also shows
the use of SqlServerEnum% for listing available servers.

The RPC sample application contains most of the stored procedure
calls in the RPC.FRM module. The RPCLOGIN.FRM file shows the use of 
SqlServerEnum%. RPC return status and output parameter handling are 
covered in RESULTSW.BAS, called by the Process_Sql_query function 
in VBSQLGEN.BAS.

The PUBS Sample Application
The PUBS sample application is a full-featured application showing
how many VBSQL functions can be combined into a business application.
This sample shows a data entry and query form for the authors in 
the pubs database. It illustrates the use of a list box for 
maintaining a key set of records, browse mode for optimistic 
concurrency, and building SQL statements based on data entered.
It also shows techniques for using Visual Basic features such as 
MDI child windows and grid controls within an application.
