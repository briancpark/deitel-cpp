; SAMPLE SQLCOMMN.LOC
; (comment character is a semicolon.)
;
;  This file is a sample.  It can be used to change
;  the default character formats for datetime and money that
;  DB-LIB performs when binding these dataypes to characters.
;  This file is optional.  If no such file is found, DB-LIB
;  simply uses its default formatting.
;
;
;  For this file to be used, it must be placed in the PATH
;  or for MS-Windows have its location defined in the
;  WIN.INI file like:
;
;   [SQLSERVER]
;    SqlLocalizationFile=C:\SQL\BIN\SQLCOMMN.LOC
;
;  The file is checked by an application program at the time of
;  dbinit().  If a file is found (or declared in WIN.INI), but it 
;  contains invalid entries, dbinit() will return NULL instead
;  of the DB-LIBRARY version string.  If no file is found or
;  declared, dbinit() returns the version string and default
;  formats are used.
;
; Currently 'shortmonths', 'dateformat', and
; 'timeformat' are the only entries used by DB-Library.
;
; 'months' and 'days' are reserved for future use.
; For additional datetime formatting, use the SQL Server
; convert() function.
