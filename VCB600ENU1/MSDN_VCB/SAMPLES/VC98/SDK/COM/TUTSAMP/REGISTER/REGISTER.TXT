
REGISTER - COM Server Registration Utility


SUMMARY
=======

The REGISTER sample builds a simple REGISTER.EXE utility that is used in
subsequent code samples to invoke DLL- or EXE-housed COM servers and
command them to register or unregister their components in the system
registry.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of REGISTER, see the
Code Tour section in REGISTER.HTM. For details on the external user
operation of REGISTER, see both the Usage and Operation sections in
REGISTER.HTM. To read REGISTER.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial
directory and click the REGISTER lesson in the table of lessons. You can
also achieve the same thing by clicking the REGISTER.HTM file after
locating the main tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer.

In general, to set up your system to build and test the code samples in
this COM Tutorial series, see the global TUTORIAL.HTM file for details.
The accompanying makefile (MAKEFILE) is Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To
create a debug build, issue the NMAKE command in the Command Prompt
window.

Usage
-----

REGISTER.EXE is an application that you can run directly from Windows or
from the Command Prompt. REGISTER is usually run from the Command Prompt
in one of the following forms:

    register myserver.dll       - To register the DLL server.
    register /u myserver.dll    - To unregister the DLL server.
    register /e myserver.exe    - To register the EXE server.
    register /u /e myserver.exe - To unregister the EXE server.
