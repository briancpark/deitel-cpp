	 MICROSOFT FOUNDATION CLASS LIBRARY : TEMPLDEF EXAMPLE PROGRAM
=======================================================================

This directory contains a utility that implements a subset of the
Proposed ANSI C++ standard syntax for templates. The TEMPLDEF
application is a console utility that requires the MFC library
NAFXCW.LIB or the debug variant NAFXCWD.LIB in order to build.

The syntax of the templates implemented and the operation of the tool
are described in the technical note TN004, which is available in the
online references. Please refer to that note for a discussion of
the templates.

This directory also contains the files required to build the collection
variants used by the MFC Library.

AFXCOLL1.H and AFXCOLL1.INL are the header file stub that prefix
the generated NEWCOLL.H and NEWCOLL.INL files.  AFXCOLL2.H and
AFXCOLL2.INL are similar files appended at the end of the generated
NEWCOLL.H and NEWCOLL.INL files.

ARRAY.CTT is the template for the array collection shape.

LIST.CTT is the template for the list collection shape.

MAP.CTT is the template for the map collection shape.

MAP_S.CTT is the template for the map collections that use
CString class objects as either the KEY or VALUE of a map.

MKCOLL.BAT is a batch file that will construct the various collection
shapes and variants that are used in the MFC library. The MFC\SRC
subdirectory already contains expanded versions of the varieties
used in the core MFC library, so the use of this tool is not required
to rebuild the library.

You may consider using these templates as a guide for developing
your own generic abstract data types.

NOTE: This tool is an example program and the syntax it supports
may change in the future. The tool is intended to support the
direct needs of MFC, and not provide a complete implementation of
C++ Templates. It is provided as a sample application only.
